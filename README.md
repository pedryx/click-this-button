## Game Mechanics

The sequence and timing of each game mechanic can be customized in the assets/sequence.seq file. It is a simple text file where each action is on its own line. Each action has the following format: <time> | <action_type> | <content>.

There are two action types:
- **Change text (T)**: Changes the text to the specified content.
- **Spawn mechanic (M)**: Spawns the game mechanic specified in the content.

The time specifies how many seconds need to elapse in order to invoke the action.
